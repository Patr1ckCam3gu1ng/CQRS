**About this take-home coding challenge:**

+ Designed in CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and adhere to SOLID design principles. 

+ The code includes a caching mechanism in C# that significantly reduces the load on the database.

+ Additionally, the code implements a retry strategy that re-attempts to processes failed processes.

+ A queue mechanism retry policy in a Background Service.

+ Implemented a “two-way commit design pattern” to guarantee data integrity in the event of system failures. This approach ensures that any changes made to the database are reverted if there is a failure in subsequent steps, such as emailing the client or syncing documents.

+ Each transaction part is treated as integral; a failure in any part triggers a rollback. This preserves the database's original state, ensuring reliability and consistency of the data.

+ Added a comprehensive unit testing. This testing verifies each function's behavior, ensuring reliability.
